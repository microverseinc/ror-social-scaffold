## About the Project

In this project, I have implemented a social media app That allows users to create an account, creates a post, comment on a post, like a post, send and receive friend requests


The app has the following features:

- User can create account/Log in

- Logged-in user can see a list of the users on the app
- Logged-in user can view profiles of all users and their posts
- Logged-in user can create posts (text only) and get likes / dislikes, and also like posts from friends
- Logged-in user has a timeline where he/she can see ONLY posts from friends
- Logged-in user can add comments to posts
- Logged-in user can send a friendship invitation and also receive invitations from other friends
- Logged-in user can decide to Accept/Reject friendship invitations
