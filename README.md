# Social Media App

## Description

This app is a Rails project for the Microverse's RoR curriculum, following TOP curriculum for webdevelopment. We have practiced how to deal with self-join tables and much more.

## About the project

In this app, you can ask people to be friends! (we don't guarantee they'll accept)

## Authorization

For asking someone to be your friend, or even see their posts, you need to log in first. You have to create an account if you don't have one - that'll require name, password and email.

## Screenshots

### Logged out. You can't see any posts, nor add friends.
