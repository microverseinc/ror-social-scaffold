# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

> Here I build a social media app using Ruby on Rails. I've implemented just basic features for now. The point is to help me get familiar with Rails. I thoroughly enjoyed working on this project, however, so I'll probably come back to add more features when I get the time.

## Built With

- Ruby v2.7.0
- Ruby on Rails v5.2.4

## Live Demo

TBA


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Ruby: 2.6.3
Rails: 5.2.3
Postgres: >=9.5

### Setup

Instal gems with:

```
bundle install
```

Setup database with:

```
   rails db:create
   rails db:migrate
```

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.


### Usage

Start server with:

```
    rails server
```

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

### Run tests

```
    rpsec --format documentation
```

> Tests will be added by Microverse students. There are no tests for initial features in order to make sure that students write all tests from scratch.


## ERD

> I created an entity relationship diagram to help me visualize the database.
