# Social Media Project
> In this project, we first designed an [ERD diagram](https://github.com/evansinho/ror-social-scaffold/pull/1) which visually displays the database schema and structure.
> We then added a friendship functionality using self-referencial relationships to the forked repositry.Database query improvements were made ontop of the friendship funtionality
> Friends can be added via a request. A request can be cancelled by user or rejected/confirmed by friend.
>  tests are run using rspec unit tests for the models, rspec controller tests and then capybara integration tests.
