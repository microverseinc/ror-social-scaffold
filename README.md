# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

> This repo includes intial code for social media app with basic styling. Its purpose is to be a starting point for Microverse students. In addition, I designed the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database tables and the associations between them; Using the ERD, I modelled a many-to-many relationship between the user and frienship model. I also added the friendship functionality to the app, which enabled logged in users to send, accept or reject friendship invitation from other users. The app was also developed with testing in view using Rspec with shoulda-matchers and Capybara. Finally, a version of the app was deployed to heroku.
